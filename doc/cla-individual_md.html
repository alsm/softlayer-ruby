<p>Thank you for your interest in the softlayer-ruby project (“the Project”).</p>

<p>In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
Contributions from any person or entity, IBM must have a Contributor
License Agreement (“CLA”) on file that has been signed by each Contributor,
indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your
protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of IBM and its
customers; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for
any other purpose.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, please complete and sign, then scan and
email a pdf file of this Agreement to
SLDNDeveloperRelations@wwpdl.vnet.ibm.com.</p>

<p>Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your
records.</p>

<p>Full name: <em>__</em></p>

<p>(optional) Public name: <em>_</em></p>

<p>Mailing Address: <em>__</em></p>

<p>Country: <em>__</em></p>

<p>Telephone: <em>__</em></p>

<p>E-Mail: <em>__</em></p>

<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present
and future Contributions submitted to the Project. Except for the license
granted herein to IBM and recipients of software distributed by IBM, You
reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Definitions.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>“You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity 
authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement  with IBM.
For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and  all other
entities that control, are controlled by, or are under  common control with
that entity are considered to be a single  Contributor. For the purposes of
this definition, “control” means  (i) the power, direct or indirect, to
cause the direction or  management of such entity, whether by contract or
otherwise,  or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding  shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p>

<p>“Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship,  including any
modifications or additions to an existing work, that  is intentionally
submitted by You to the Project for inclusion  in, or documentation of, the
Project (”the Work”). For the purposes  of this definition, “submitted”
means any form of electronic, verbal,  or written communication sent to the
Project or its representatives,  including but not limited to communication
on electronic mailing lists,  source code control systems, and issue
tracking systems that are  managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the
purpose of discussing  and improving the Work, but excluding communication
that is conspicuously  marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as
“Not a Contribution.”</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Grant of Copyright License.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant  to
IBM and to recipients of software distributed by IBM a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright 
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, 
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and  such
derivative works.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Grant of Patent License.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant  to
IBM and to recipients of software distributed by IBM a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except  as
stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer  to
sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work to which Your 
Contribution(s) were submitted, where such license applies only to those 
patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your 
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the 
Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes 
patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim 
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work 
to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent 
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this 
Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date 
such litigation is filed.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above  license.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property  that you create
that includes your Contributions, you represent  that you have received
permission to make Contributions on behalf  of that employer, that your
employer has waived such rights for  your Contributions to the Project, or
that your employer has  executed a separate Corporate CLA with IBM.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original  creation
(see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You  represent that
Your Contribution submissions include complete  details of any third-party
license or other restriction (including,  but not limited to, related
patents and trademarks) of which you  are personally aware and which are
associated with any part of Your  Contributions.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,  except to
the extent You desire to provide support.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.  Unless
required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your 
Contributions on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS  OF ANY
KIND, either express or implied, including, without  limitation, any
warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-  INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,  You may
submit it to the Project separately from any  Contribution, identifying the
complete details of its source and of  any license or other restriction
(including, but not limited to,  related patents, trademarks, and license
agreements) of which you  are personally aware, and conspicuously marking
the work as  "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".</p>
</li><li>
<p>You agree to notify IBM of any facts or circumstances of  which you become
aware that would make these representations  inaccurate in any respect.</p>
</li></ol>
